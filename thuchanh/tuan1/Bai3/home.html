        After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion,
        it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful
        performances.

        I've started putting up a <a href="slide1.html">slide show</a> of the
        production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If
        you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.
