      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <img src="smith.jpg" alt="hinhSmith" />
      <p>
        Linear Smith Machines are the ultimate in weight machines and the LSM400
        leads the field. Designed for both serious fitness users and beginners,
        the LSM400's vertical design provides all of the safety and control
        associated with Smith Machines, while still allowing for the effective
        use of gravity for effective resistance. You don't even need a workout
        partner. Lock points can be set to prevent the bar from movement outside
        of your body's natural range of motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can tailor the LSM400 to meet you specific workout needs. Start with
        the basic package of the Smith Machine rack and, as your needs grow, add
        a lat/row, pec dec, plate tree, dip, and accessory organizer.
        Accessories are easy to insert and remove, allowing you to continue your
        workout without delay. The LSM400 works with all standard Olympic weight
        plates
      </p>
      <p>
        The LSM400 is compact with all components place one side of the unit for
        easy access. This makes the LSM400 perfect for people who want a quality
        home gym, but do not have a lot of space. Place the LSM400 against a
        wall and you're ready to go!

      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Smooth Smith Action:</b> The bar (rated at 800 lb. capacity) slides
          on Teflon bushings alongside solid steel guide rods. Smooth motion is
          key to successful workouts, as the target muscles are utilized to
          their full potential with each repetition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Proper Angle:</b> The bar travels along a 7 degree path from
          vertical. Studies have shown that this is the proper lifting angle to
          increase your comfort and prevent injury.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Safety: </b>The LSM400 has 20 lock-out points for a safe, solid
          stop at any point in your workout routine.

        <li>
          <b>Rugged </b>: Constructed with heavy 12 gauge steel and 7 gauge
          reinforcing plate. This is a unit built to last.
